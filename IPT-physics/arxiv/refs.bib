It is the first book to integrate Lie algebras, algebraic perturbation theory and symbolic computation in a form suitable for students and researchers in theoretical and computational chemistry and is conveniently divided into two parts. The first part, Chapters 1 to 6, provides a pedagogical introduction to the important Lie algebras so(3), so(2,1), so(4) and so(4,2) needed for the study of simple quantum systems such as the D-dimensional hydrogen atom and harmonic oscillator. This material is suitable for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students. Of particular importance is the use of so(2,1) in Chapter 4 as a spectrum generating algebra for several important systems such as the non-relativistic hydrogen atom and the relativistic Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations. This approach provides an interesting and important alternative to the usual textbook approach using series solutions of differential equations.},

  abstract = {The computation of observables in general interacting theories, be them quantum mechanical, field, gauge or string theories, is a non-trivial problem which in many cases can only be addressed by resorting to perturbative methods. In most physically interesting problems these perturbative expansions result in asymptotic series with zero radius of convergence. These asymptotic series then require the use of resurgence and transseries in order for the associated observables to become nonperturbatively well-defined. Resurgence encodes the complete largeorder asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients from a perturbative expansion, generically in terms of (multi) instanton sectors and for each problem in terms of its Stokes constants. Some observables arise from linear problems, and have a finite number of instanton sectors and associated Stokes constants; some other observables arise from nonlinear problems, and have an infinite number of instanton sectors and Stokes constants. By means of two very explicit examples, and with emphasis on a pedagogical style of presentation, this work aims at serving as a primer on the aforementioned resurgent, large-order asymptotics of general perturbative expansions. This includes discussions of transseries, Stokes phenomena, generalized steepest-descent methods, Borel transforms, nonlinear resonance, and alien calculus. Furthermore, resurgent properties of transseries\textemdash usually described mathematically via alien calculus\textemdash are recast in equivalent physical languages: either a ``statistical mechanical'' language, as motions in chains and lattices; or a ``conformal field theoretical'' language, with underlying Virasoro-like algebraic structures.},

This model is interesting because the perturbation series for the ground-state energy diverges. To investigate the reason for this divergence, we analytically continue the energy levels of the Hamiltonian H into the complex {$\lambda$} plane. Using WKB techniques, we find that the energy levels as a function of {$\lambda$}, or more generally of {$\lambda\alpha$}, have an infinite number of branch points with a limit point at {$\lambda$}=0. Thus, the origin is not an isolated singularity. Level crossing occurs at each branch point. If we choose {$\alpha$}=13, the resolvent (z-H)-1 has no branch cut. However, for all z it has an infinite sequence of poles which have a limit point at the origin. The anharmonic oscillator is of particular interest to field theoreticians because it is a model of {$\lambda\phi$}4 field theory in one-dimensional space-time. The unusual and unexpected properties exhibited by this model may give some indication of the analytic structure of a more realistic field theory.},

Because infrared renormalons probe large distances, they are closely connected with non-perturbative power corrections in asymptotically free theories such as QCD.

  abstract = {This review is focused on the borderline region of theoretical physics and mathematics. First, we describe numerical methods for the acceleration of the convergence of series. These provide a useful toolbox for theoretical physics which has hitherto not received the attention it actually deserves. The unifying concept for convergence acceleration methods is that in many cases, one can reach much faster convergence than by adding a particular series term by term. In some cases, it is even possible to use a divergent input series, together with a suitable sequence transformation, for the construction of numerical methods that can be applied to the calculation of special functions. This review both aims to provide some practical guidance as well as a groundwork for the study of specialized literature. As a second topic, we review some recent developments in the field of Borel resummation, which is generally recognized as one of the most versatile methods for the summation of factorially divergent (perturbation) series. Here, the focus is on algorithms which make optimal use of all information contained in a finite set of perturbative coefficients. The unifying concept for the various aspects of the Borel method investigated here is given by the singularities of the Borel transform, which introduce ambiguities from a mathematical point of view and lead to different possible physical interpretations. The two most important cases are: (i) the residues at the singularities correspond to the decay width of a resonance; and (ii) the presence of the singularities indicates the existence of nonperturbative contributions which cannot be accounted for on the basis of a Borel resummation and require generalizations toward resurgent expansions. Both of these cases are illustrated by examples.},

Special attention is given to a simple derivation of the form of these Hamiltonians in terms of the so(2, 1) algebra generators. In particular, the usually exploited tilting transformation is avoided, and the whole derivation is presented in an extremely simple and straightforward way. The present approach stresses the similarity and mutual relationship between the systems studied and, in addition to introducing some novel techniques and providing considerable insight into the overall structure of these problems, also has a definite pedagogical value.},

It is emphasized that there is a formal similarity between divergent series in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and those series occurring in quantum field theory. It is indicated that studies of divergent series in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics can be helpful in the verification of suminability techniques in quantum field theory. The general problems of the application of perturbation theory to the study of the hydrogen atom in external fields are discussed. It is shown how the problem of the continuous spectrum can be bypassed. Further it is shown that algebraic techniques are very useful for a transparent formulation of perturbation theory. The theory is applied to the study of the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field and in an electric field and also to the study of the hydrogen molecule ion. The results for the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field and the hydrogen molecule ion are discussed in detail and the large order behavior of perturbation terms is compared with analytic formulas. Finally the questions of the summability for the series corresponding to the quartic anharmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field are discussed. It is seen that large order perturbation theory can be built into a continued fraction representation of a divergent perturbation series. Numerical results are presented for the two perturbation series mentioned above.},

It provides a systematic construction, illustrated with examples, of the various theories of summability and the theory of resurgence developed since the 1980s. The Stokes phenomenon, for both linear and non-linear equations, plays an underlying and unifying role throughout the volumes. Applications presented include resurgent analyses of the First Painlev\'e equation and of the tangent-to-identity germs of diffeomorphisms of C, and links to differential Galois theory and the Riemann-Hilbert problem for linear differential equations. The volumes are aimed at graduate students, mathematicians in general, and theoretical physicists who are interested in the theories of monodromy, summability, and resurgence, as well as the current problems in the field.Although the three volumes are closely related, they have been organized to be read independently. The prerequisites are advanced calculus, especially holomorphic functions in one complex variable, and differential algebra. Moreover; the various themes are presented thoroughly step-by-step so as to be accessible to first-year graduate students in mathematics. This three-volume treatise should become a reference on summability and resurgence.},

  abstract = {This volume is concerned with the determination of the behaviour of perturbation theory at large orders in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, and its application to the problem of summation of perturbation series.Perturbation series in quantum field theory and in many quantum mechanics models are only asymptotic and thus diverge for all values of the expansion parameter. Their behaviour at large orders provides information about whether they define the theory uniquely (the problem of Borel summability). It suggests methods to extract numerical information from the series when the expansion parameter is not small.The articles reprinted here deal with the explicit evaluation of large-order behaviour in many quantum mechanics and field theory models. The large-order behaviour is related to barrier penetration effects for unphysical values of the expansion parameter, which can be calculated by WKB or instanton methods. The calculation of critical exponents of \&fgr;4 field theory is presented as a practical application.},

  abstract = {This book places thermodynamics on a system-theoretic foundation so as to harmonize it with classical mechanics. Using the highest standards of exposition and rigor, the authors develop a novel formulation of thermodynamics that can be viewed as a moderate-sized system theory as compared to statistical thermodynamics. This middle-ground theory involves deterministic large-scale dynamical system models that bridge the gap between classical and statistical thermodynamics. The authors' theory is motivated by the fact that a discipline as cardinal as thermodynamics--entrusted with some of the most perplexing secrets of our universe--demands far more than physical mathematics as its underpinning. Even though many great physicists, such as Archimedes, Newton, and Lagrange, have humbled us with their mathematically seamless eurekas over the centuries, this book suggests that a great many physicists and engineers who have developed the theory of thermodynamics seem to have forgotten that mathematics, when used rigorously, is the irrefutable pathway to truth. This book uses system theoretic ideas to bring coherence, clarity, and precision to an extremely important and poorly understood classical area of science.},

The basic notions are introduced using ordinary integrals. The theoretical framework is applied to quantum mechanics and generalized to quantum field theories which, in particular, have important applications in the theory of critical phenomena. The material is presented at three levels of complexity: a) undergraduate, b) post-quantum mechanics I, c) graduate up to current research. The second part starts with a general introduction to resummation methods for divergent series. Subsequently, Borel's theory is implemented as a simple algorithm allowing for easy practical applications to numerous problems. This is illustrated for three typical examples, again with the above three levels of complexity. All non-trivial algebraic manipulation are programmed in special computer languages (REDUCE and RIEMANN). These algebraic as well as some numerical computer programs are supplied on a diskette to come with the book.},

Thanks to the high parallelism of these basic linear algebra operations, we obtain excellent performance on multi-core processors and GPUs, with large speed-ups over standard methods (up to \$\textbackslash sim50\$x with respect to LAPACK and ARPACK). For matrices which are not close to being diagonal but have well-separated eigenvalues, IPT can be be used to refine low-precision eigenpairs obtained by other methods. We give sufficient conditions for linear convergence and demonstrate performance on dense and sparse test matrices. In a real-world application from quantum chemistry, we find that IPT performs similarly to the Davidson algorithm.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen striking progress in the subject of renormalization in quantum field theory. The old subject of perturbative renormalization has been revived by the use of powerful methods such as multiscale decompositions; precise estimates have been added to the initial theorems on finiteness of renormalized perturbation theory, with new results on its large order asymptotics. Furthermore, constructive field theory has reached one of its major goals, the mathematically rigorous construction of some renormalizable quantum field theories. For these models one can in particular investigate rigorously the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom, which plays a key role in our current understanding of the interaction among elementary particles. However, until this book, there has been no pedagogical synthesis of these new developments. Vincent Rivasseau, who has been actively involved in them, now describes them for a wider audience. There are, in fact, common concepts at the heart of the progress on perturbative and constructive techniques. Exploiting these similarities, the author uses perturbative renormalization, which is the more widely known and conceptually simpler of the two cases, to explain the less familiar but more mathematically meaningful constructive renormalization.Originally published in 1991.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.},

Generally, finite partial sums of this perturbation series do not show convergence with increasing order, but tend to diverge exponentially.

(b) On the threesheeted surface, {$\beta$} = 0 is not an isolated singularity; thus, there are infinitely many singularities. (c) The singularities have {$\pm$} 270\textdegree{} as asymptotic phase. We also show that the perturbation series is asymptotic uniformly in any sector |arg{$\beta$}| {$<$} \texttheta{} with \texttheta{} {$<$}3{$\pi$}2. We extend these results to many dimensional oscillators and x2m perturbations. Finally, we study the Pad\'e approximants formed from the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger series. Since En({$\beta$}) has no singularities in the cut plane |arg{$\beta$}| {$<\pi$} (using results of references [37, 38]), the Pad\'e approximants f[N,N+j] converge as N \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$} for j fixed, and yield En.

Equations for optimal sets of level shift parameters are presented. Attention is paid to the specific problems appearing if the zero order solution is not a single Slater determinant. A special formalism for multi-configurational perturbation theories is outlined. It is shown that divergent perturbation series, like that of an anharmonic oscillator, can be converted to a convergent series by an appropriate redefinition of the zero order Hamiltonian via level shifts. The possible use of effective one-particle energies in many-body perturbation theory is also discussed. Partitioning optimization in a constant denominator perturbation theory leads to second order correction familiar from connected moment expansion techniques. Ionization potentials, computed perturbatively, are found sensitive to the choice of partitioning, and ordinary approximations are improved upon level shift optimization.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with a special class of the ``double-well-like'' potentials that occur naturally in the analysis of finite quantum systems. Special attention is paid, in particular, to the so-called Fokker-Planck potential, which has a particular property: the perturbation series for the ground-state energy vanishes to all orders in the coupling parameter, but the actual ground-state energy is positive and dominated by instanton configurations of the form exp(-a/g), where a is the instanton action. The instanton effects are most naturally taken into account within the modified Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions whose expansion leads to the generalized perturbative expansions (so-called resurgent expansions) for the energy eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck potential. Until now, these resurgent expansions have been mainly applied for small values of coupling parameter g, while much less attention has been paid to the strong-coupling regime. In this contribution, we compare the energy values, obtained by directly resumming generalized Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions, to the strong-coupling expansion, for which we determine the first few expansion coefficients in powers of g-2/3. Detailed calculations are performed for a wide range of coupling parameters g and indicate a considerable overlap between the regions of validity of the weak-coupling resurgent series and of the strong-coupling expansion. Apart from the analysis of the energy spectrum of the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian, we also briefly discuss the computation of its eigenfunctions. These eigenfunctions may be utilized for the numerical integration of the (single-particle) time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation and, hence, for studying the dynamical evolution of the wave packets in the double-well-like potentials.},

The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student's appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},

Generalizations of perturbation theory are necessary, which include instanton configurations, characterized by non-analytic factors exp(-a/g) where a is a constant and g is the coupling. In the case of one-dimensional quantum mechanical potentials with two or more degenerate minima, the energy levels may be represented as an infinite sum of terms each of which involves a certain power of a non-analytic factor and represents itself an infinite divergent series. We attempt to provide a unified representation of related derivations previously found scattered in the literature. For the considered quantum mechanical problems, we discuss the derivation of the instanton contributions from a semi-classical calculation of the corresponding partition function in the path integral formalism. We also explain the relation with the corresponding WKB expansion of the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation, or alternatively of the Fredholm determinant det(H-E) (and some explicit calculations that verify this correspondence). We finally recall how these conjectures naturally emerge from a leading-order summation of multi-instanton contributions to the path integral representation of the partition function.},
